# @bota-apps/react-ui

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- ed5439e: Non-modal SidePanel and a docked, richer issue reporter.

  - `SidePanel` (react-ui): a non-modal companion panel that docks at the right
    edge of a layout — no focus trap, no backdrop, the app stays interactive
    beside it. Width presets (md/lg/xl) with built-in widen/narrow controls
    (hidden below `md`, where the panel becomes a viewport-wide overlay that
    never exceeds the device width). Children stay mounted while closed, so
    in-progress form state survives close/reopen.
  - App shell (react-components): new optional `panel` slot on `AppShell`,
    `AppShellLayout`, and both layouts — the panel shares the content row below
    the header and pushes the content well narrower instead of overlaying it.
  - `IssueReporter` (react-components):
    - `variant="panel"` renders the form in a SidePanel for the shell's `panel`
      slot; the sheet presentation remains the default. Panel drafts persist
      across close/reopen; `prefillKey` forces the draft to be replaced with
      fresh defaults.
    - `defaultTechnicalContext` + `technicalContext` on `CreateIssuePayload`:
      machine-captured diagnostics ride along with the report for triage — the
      reporter shows a short "details attached" notice instead of dumping raw
      payloads into user-facing fields. `IssueDetails` renders the attached
      context in a mono "Technical details" section.
    - Built-in one-click screen capture via the native Screen Capture API
      (`getDisplayMedia`) where supported: the browser picker lets the user
      share the current tab, a window, or a screen, one frame is grabbed as a
      PNG into the screenshot list, and the stream stops immediately. File
      upload stays available; the control hides on unsupported browsers.
      Chosen over DOM-rasterization libraries, which fail on modern CSS colors
      (oklch) and canvas/WebGL content.
    - The feature picker shows each node's new optional `description`
      (`FeatureNodeDef.description`, @bota-apps/types) under its label.

  - @bota-apps/types@0.11.0
  - @bota-apps/schema-utils@0.9.4

## 0.19.2

### Patch Changes

- b8a7e97: Restore rail-anchored content in the sidebar layout. The centered well
  introduced in the previous release read as a floating left gutter next to the
  fixed rail — the content well and capped `PageContent` widths are anchored to
  the start edge again, with spare width staying on the right. The `wide` width
  variant and the well's generous cap are unchanged; only `narrow` content
  centers itself.

## 0.19.1

### Patch Changes

- 9faacc8: `Heading` (typography) now renders in the theme's display voice like the other
  heading primitives — `font-display` falls back to the sans stack for brands
  without a display face, so brands that don't set one are unaffected.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 7ef9f0f: Semantic status tones everywhere, an `info` badge variant, and a `wide` page width.

  - All remaining raw-palette status styling now renders through the semantic
    `status-*` tokens: statusDot, activityFeed, timeline, statusLegend, alert,
    toast/toastNotification, stepper connector lines, actionCenter, statCard,
    readinessSummary, documentChecklist, numericText, table row severities, and
    the react-components toast stack. Brands that tune the status token families
    now restyle these components with no per-component overrides.
  - `Badge` gains an `info` variant (subtle info surface pair), completing the
    status set alongside `success`/`warning`/`muted`.
  - `PageContent`/`PageContainer` gain a `wide` width variant (`max-w-[96rem]`)
    for dense work surfaces such as wide tables and boards.
  - The sidebar app-shell content well is now centered under a `96rem` cap
    instead of left-anchored at `80rem`, so spare width on large screens splits
    symmetrically instead of pooling as a dead right gutter. Pages keep their
    own width policy via `PageContent` (`default` still caps at `80rem`).

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [12d6d67]
  - @bota-apps/tailwind-preset@0.13.0

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- e339187: FileUpload selection preview rows now open a full-size lightbox. Activating a
  row (its thumbnail/name area is a button labelled "Preview {name}") opens a
  modal viewer: images and PDFs embed inline via object URLs (revoked when the
  stage unmounts), other formats show their format icon with a "Preview not
  available" fallback. With more than one file selected the lightbox pages
  through the whole selection — Previous/Next buttons, an "n of m" position
  readout, and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight keys — and a remove action deletes the
  staged file, staging the next one (closing when none remain).

  New overridable strings: `FileUploadPreview` gains `previewLabel`,
  `closeLabel`, `previousLabel`, `nextLabel`, `positionLabel`, and
  `previewUnavailableLabel`; `FileUpload` forwards them as `previewFileLabel`,
  `previewCloseLabel`, `previewPreviousLabel`, `previewNextLabel`,
  `previewPositionLabel`, and `previewUnavailableLabel`. New variants:
  `fileUploadPreviewTriggerVariants` and the `fileUploadLightbox*` family
  (content, stage, image, footer, nav, position).

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- 4e58a4f: FileUpload: pre-upload selection preview, controlled selection mode, and container-responsive layout.

  - New controlled mode: pass `files` + `onFilesChange` and the control renders a confirmation preview under the trigger (both `dropzone` and `button` variants). The app keeps ownership of the file list; `onFilesSelected` stays available for each accepted batch. The existing fire-and-forget mode (`onFilesSelected` alone) is unchanged.
  - Selection semantics: in single mode a new pick replaces the current selection; with `multiple`, picks accumulate and identical files (same name, size, mtime, type) are skipped. Validation rejections (`accept`/`maxSizeBytes` → `onInvalidFiles`) work in both modes.
  - New `FileUploadPreview` component (exported from the module, also usable standalone): image rows render object-URL thumbnails (revoked on removal/unmount), other formats reuse the shared file-format icon with name and human-readable size; per-row remove buttons with accessible names, and a clear-all action for multi-file selections. Labels are overridable (`selectedListLabel`, `removeFileLabel`, `clearAllLabel` on FileUpload; `listLabel`, `removeLabel`, `clearAllLabel` on the preview).
  - Container-scoped responsiveness: the control now renders its own `@container` wrapper; dropzone padding/icon scale with the container, preview rows go two-column in wide containers, and long file names truncate. Markup note: the trigger and hidden input are now wrapped in a `div` (previously a fragment) — styling that assumed the trigger was a direct child of the consumer's layout may need a look.
  - New variant exports: `fileUploadRootVariants` (+ `FileUploadRootVariantProps`) and the `fileUploadPreview*Variants` family.

- dd17920: Make the remaining hardcoded English micro-copy in `DocumentChecklist`, `ReadinessSummary`, and `ProcessTimeline` overridable, so the components can be adopted in fully-translated apps without an i18n regression (per the repo's "English defaults, injectable translations" rule).

  - `DocumentChecklist` gains `statusLabels` (per-key override of Provided/Missing/Pending/Expired), `requiredLabel`, `optionalLabel`, and `progressLabel(provided, total)` for the "{provided} of {total} provided" caption.
  - `ReadinessSummary` gains `progressLabel(complete, total)` for the "{complete} of {total} complete" caption.
  - `ProcessTimeline` gains `summaryLabel(step, total, label)` for the compact "Step {n} of {m} — …" summary shown below a horizontal timeline in narrow containers.

  All new props are optional and default to the previous English strings — no change for existing callers.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 08bcf92: Freight brand, product surfaces, and semantic status tokens:

  - **New brand `freight`** — a logistics-operations look: corridor-blue
    primary over cool-neutral surfaces, dark navy rail, signal-orange accent
    reserved for manual-intervention emphasis, Inter voice, crisp 0.25rem
    corners, and deep blue-black dark mode. The brand file also carries
    geo/map product tokens (`--map-panel-*`, `--map-marker-*`, `--map-route-*`,
    `--map-location-*`, `--map-cluster-*`, `--map-overlay-scrim`) for
    map-centric screens — planned vs observed routes, live/reported/estimated/
    stale positions — kept out of `theme.css` on purpose.
  - **`brandCss` learns `surfaces`** — per-product-surface override blocks
    scoped to `:root[data-brand][data-product-surface="<surface>"]` (+ `.dark`),
    so one brand can serve a dense operations console and a comfortable
    customer portal without forking. The shipped `freight` brand includes
    `operations` and `customer` surfaces.
  - **Semantic status token families** in `theme.css` + preset colors:
    `status-{info,success,warning,danger,neutral}` each with solid
    (`DEFAULT`/`foreground`) and subtle (`subtle`/`subtle-foreground`) pairs,
    re-tuned for dark mode. Status meaning now has canonical tokens instead of
    raw palette classes.
  - **Badge families resolve status colors through the new tokens** —
    `BadgeEl` success/warning/muted, `IconBadgeEl` info/success/warning, and
    `StepBubbleEl` info/success/warning now render from `status-*` tokens
    (dropping their hardcoded green/yellow/gray classes and `dark:` variants),
    so badge status colors follow the theme in both modes under every brand.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [08bcf92]
  - @bota-apps/tailwind-preset@0.12.0

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 8eb9615: Paper-look brand family and a stronger brand voice end to end:

  - **New brands `kraft` and `blueprint`**, and a bolder `ledger`: ledger now
    pairs its manila page with a dark ink-navy rail; kraft is brown wrapping
    paper with stamp-green primary and slab display headings; blueprint is pale
    drafting paper with a deep blue rail, square corners, and a monospace
    display voice.
  - **Headings now render in the theme's display face** (`font-display`). The
    token defaults to `var(--font-sans)`, so nothing changes until a brand sets
    its own display stack — then every heading carries the brand (manuscript's
    serif headings finally show).
  - **Sidebar layout: the content well is anchored to the rail** instead of
    centered in the remaining space, which read as a giant left gutter on wide
    screens. The well keeps a `max-w-7xl` cap and its gutters; spare width now
    stays on the right.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [0e2d5b4]
  - @bota-apps/tailwind-preset@0.10.0

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 3dc31c8: Add `FileUpload` — a file selection control with `dropzone` and `button` variants. A visually hidden `<input type="file">` is driven by a real button (full keyboard support), the dropzone accepts drag-and-drop with a visible drag-over state, and client-side validation routes files failing `accept`/`maxSizeBytes` to `onInvalidFiles` with a typed reason (`"size" | "type"`). Labels and the hint line are injectable with English defaults (the hint derives from `accept`/`maxSizeBytes` when set), and `busy`/`disabled` states are announced via `aria-busy`/`aria-disabled`. Exports `FileUploadProps`, `FileUploadRejection`, `FileUploadVariant`, `FileUploadSize`, and the cva variants.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- d2ae36c: Make the remaining hardcoded English micro-copy in `DocumentChecklist`, `ReadinessSummary`, and `ProcessTimeline` overridable, so the components can be adopted in fully-translated apps without an i18n regression (per the repo's "English defaults, injectable translations" rule).

  - `DocumentChecklist` gains `statusLabels` (per-key override of Provided/Missing/Pending/Expired), `requiredLabel`, `optionalLabel`, and `progressLabel(provided, total)` for the "{provided} of {total} provided" caption.
  - `ReadinessSummary` gains `progressLabel(complete, total)` for the "{complete} of {total} complete" caption.
  - `ProcessTimeline` gains `summaryLabel(step, total, label)` for the compact "Step {n} of {m} — …" summary shown below a horizontal timeline in narrow containers.

  All new props are optional and default to the previous English strings — no change for existing callers.

### Patch Changes

- 4ca7727: Add "which one do I use" selection guidance to the doc comments of the three vertical marker-rail components — `Timeline`, `ActivityFeed`, and `ProcessTimeline` — so consumers pick the right primitive: `Timeline` for a styled rail of discrete events, `ActivityFeed` for a chronological stream of recent activity, and `ProcessTimeline` for a fixed lifecycle (complete/current/upcoming). No API changes.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- ab5fed8: Add five foundational, domain-neutral surfaces for detail pages and dashboards,
  plus `Dl`/`Dt`/`Dd` html primitives:

  - **`StatusLegend`** — a compact key mapping colored (and optionally icon-shaped)
    swatches to labels; horizontal or vertical; semantic list; color is never the
    only signal.
  - **`EntitySummary`** — a label/value fact surface using semantic `<dl>` markup;
    container-query column reflow (1→2→3), comfortable/compact density, full-width
    items for long values.
  - **`ActivityFeed`** — a human-readable, chronological event feed (distinct from a
    compliance audit log); tone-tinted markers, optional connectors, density, and a
    zero-state.
  - **`ReadinessSummary`** — an optional progress bar with a worded count plus
    grouped, optionally-actionable issues (router-neutral `onSelect`); positive
    zero-state; readiness never communicated by color alone.
  - **`ActionCenter`** — a router-neutral "next actions" panel; each action renders
    as a keyboard-operable button (via `onSelect`) or a static row, with an urgency
    icon tone and a trailing slot. Exposes `actionCenterItemVariants` as the shared
    styling recipe for a future router-aware wrapper.

  Each ships its cva variants (`<name>Variants` + tone/status/density unions),
  stories, and tests. Interaction states use `muted`/`selected` (never `accent`),
  and all motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- b32b034: Add domain-neutral visualization and comparison surfaces to `@bota-apps/react-ui`
  and its `./charts` subpath:

  - **`ComparisonTable`** — a typed, generic (`<T>`) side-by-side comparison of a
    bounded set of options across labeled attributes. Column states
    (recommended/lowest/highest/selected/unavailable) are shown with badges + text
    (never color alone); accessible selection; container-query reflow from table to
    stacked cards in narrow containers.
  - **`MoneyBreakdown`** — a financial summary using semantic `<dl>` markup:
    optional grouped sections + subtotals, positive/negative values (rendered with a
    real minus glyph), a distinguished total, and `default`/`document` (print) variants.
    Values are caller-formatted — the component never formats currency.
  - **`RouteDiagram`** — a 2D SVG diagram of a staged, multi-leg journey. Node status
    (complete/current/upcoming) is conveyed by shape + text, not color alone; a
    semantic ordered-list summary backs the SVG for screen readers and print; optional
    CSS path-draw reveal that is static under `prefers-reduced-motion`; container-query
    switch to a vertical layout in narrow containers.
  - **`DocumentChecklist`** — a document-completeness surface: per-item status
    (provided/missing/pending/expired) with icon + text, required/optional in words, a
    worded completeness count and progress bar, router-neutral `onSelect`, trailing
    action slot, and a zero-state. Presentational only — no upload/routing.
  - **`WaterfallChart`** (`./charts`) — a Recharts waterfall explaining how a starting
    value becomes an ending value via signed steps; injectable value formatter; tooltip;
    a required accessible table alternative; standard/compact variants; animation gated
    on `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - **`VarianceHeatmap`** (`./charts`) — an accessible `<table>` heatmap (no Recharts)
    with a diverging token color scale; every cell shows its numeric value as text plus
    a per-cell `aria-label`; a scale legend; horizontal scroll in narrow containers.

  Each ships cva variants (`<name>Variants` + state/variant unions), stories, and tests.
  Interaction states use `muted`/`selected` (never `accent`).

- 17efd87: Add `ProcessTimeline` — a domain-neutral process-status component for ordered
  lifecycle steps. Each item is `complete`, `current`, `upcoming`, `blocked`, or
  `skipped`; the component renders a semantic `<ol>`, marks the active step with
  `aria-current="step"`, and never conveys status by color alone (every marker
  carries a default shape icon and each item a visually-hidden, overridable
  status label).

  - `orientation` (`vertical` | `horizontal`) and `density` (`comfortable` |
    `compact`) variants; horizontal collapses per-step labels to a compact
    "Step x of n" summary below the `@2xl` container width.
  - Optional `showConnectors`, controlled selection via `selectedItemId` +
    `onItemSelect` (items become keyboard-operable buttons only when selectable).
  - Exposes `processTimelineVariants` and the marker/connector/item cva recipes,
    plus the `ProcessTimelineItemStatus` / orientation / density unions.
  - Color transitions collapse to instant under `prefers-reduced-motion`; no
    JS-driven animation.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 1df93c4: `Span` gains two responsive `display` variants for header-chrome composition, so apps can collapse control labels on phones without raw class overrides:

  - `display="srOnlyMobile"` — visible from the `sm` viewport up, screen-reader-only below (button labels that cost too much header width on phones).
  - `display="hiddenMobile"` — hidden below the `sm` viewport, `inline-flex` from it (decorative chrome such as keyboard-shortcut hints).

  `AppShell`'s sign-out label now uses `srOnlyMobile`.

### Patch Changes

- 1df93c4: `TimelineItem`: the title/meta row now wraps in narrow containers — the timestamp drops under the title instead of pushing the row wider than the timeline's container.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- d64ff10: Container-scoped responsiveness sweep: components adapt to the container they are given — from 320px phone panels to very wide monitors — instead of assuming they own the viewport, and the app shell gets a proper narrow-screen layout.

  **@bota-apps/react-ui**

  - `Grid` (and `gridVariants`): multi-column grids are now container-scoped. Column classes changed from `md:grid-cols-*`/`lg:grid-cols-*` to `@xl:grid-cols-*`/`@4xl:grid-cols-*`, and a multi-column `Grid` renders its own `@container` wrapper element around the grid. Anything selecting the grid as a direct child of its previous parent, or asserting on the old classes, must account for the wrapper. Single-column grids are unchanged.
  - `SectionHeader` / `SectionHeaderEl` / `sectionHeaderVariants` / `SectionHeaderActionsEl`: the title-to-actions column/row switch is now container-scoped (`@xl:` instead of `sm:`), and `SectionHeaderEl` renders its own `@container` wrapper.
  - `PageHeader` / `pageHeaderVariants`: the header row now wraps (`flex-wrap` + gaps) so the action drops below the title in narrow columns instead of squeezing the title.
  - `TabNav` / `navVariants` (`tabBar`) / `tabNavLinkVariants`: tab bars are now container-scoped — a scrollable full-width strip in narrow containers, the inline pill row from the `@2xl` container width (previously keyed off the `md` viewport breakpoint). `TabNavContainerEl` carries the `@container` scope.
  - `DataTable`: the table-to-cards switch now reacts to the table's own container width (below ~640px it renders `mobileRenderItem` cards) instead of the viewport, so a table in a narrow panel becomes cards even on a wide screen. The toolbar layout picker hides in narrow containers, and toolbar padding is container-scoped. `TableDataWrapperEl` now carries the `@container` scope.
  - `PageContent` / `pageContentVariants`: no longer applies its own gutters (`px-3 md:px-4` and the per-region `py`/`pt`/`pb` are removed) — the app-shell content well owns page padding; stacking both visibly wasted width on phones. Pages rendered outside an app shell must now provide their own padding.
  - `useChartHeight` (charts): now returns `{ ref, height }` instead of a number — attach `ref` to the chart's measuring wrapper. The `"responsive"` size resolves against the chart's own container width, not the viewport. New exported type `ChartHeightResult`.
  - `OnboardingSteps`: inactive step labels and separators collapse in narrow containers (only the active step keeps its label); renders its own `@container` wrapper.
  - `DetailField`: long values now wrap inside the field instead of widening it (`min-w-0` value column + `break-words`).
  - `ButtonGroup`: wraps in narrow containers instead of overflowing.
  - Dialog/alert-dialog panels (`modalContentVariants`): capped to the small-viewport height and scrollable past it.
  - New export: `useContainerWidth` — ResizeObserver-based hook for container-scoped layout switches that live in logic rather than classes.

  **@bota-apps/react-components**

  - `AppShellLayout` (sidebar): the rail now hides below the `md` viewport breakpoint (previously `sm`) and a menu button in the header opens the same brand + nav in a left sheet; the contextual header slot truncates instead of wrapping word-per-line; header/content padding tightens on phones; the content well widens on very wide screens (`min-[1800px]:max-w-7xl`).
  - `AppShellLayout` (topnav): the contextual header slot hides below `lg` and truncates above it; the nav slot clips non-measuring content so it can't overlap the header actions; same phone padding and wide-screen cap as the sidebar layout.
  - `AppShell`: the sign-out button collapses to icon-only on phones (label stays for screen readers) and the signed-in text truncates.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 888d537: Scroll-aware motion primitives — communicate arrival, magnitude, and process without any new runtime dependency (IntersectionObserver + CSS transitions + rAF on the existing motion tokens).

  New components:

  - `Reveal` / `RevealGroup` — one-time entrance (`fade` | `fadeUp` | `fadeDown` | `zoom`) when content first scrolls into view; `RevealGroup` staggers its children. Server markup, reduced-motion users, and browsers without IntersectionObserver always render the resting state — content is never stranded hidden.
  - `AnimatedNumber` — counts up when first visible and tweens between value changes. Sized by the final value so there is no layout shift, tabular figures, aria-hidden frames with the final value exposed to assistive technology; snaps instantly under reduced motion.
  - `StepFlow` — numbered vertical walkthrough for process storytelling: a progress rail fills as the reader scrolls, passed steps solidify, the current step highlights with the selected tokens. All movement is scrubbed 1:1 by the reader's own scrolling.
  - `usePrefersReducedMotion` — reactive reduced-motion flag the primitives are built on, exported for app-level motion.

  Extended:

  - `Hero` gained the animated `treatment="aurora"`: two blurred ramp-tinted blobs drifting on the new preset keyframes — transform-only, brand/dark-aware through the numeric ramps, and stilled under `motion-reduce`.
  - New `Ol` primitive in the html layer (ordered-list counterpart to `Ul`).

- fd74d2e: One icon-placement and content-composition grammar for every card surface.

  Icons on cards previously varied in size, tint, shape, and position from one
  component to the next (bare 40px glyphs above titles, 48–64px circles, 40px
  rounded squares, per-component svg sizing). This release makes the icon badge
  the single tile primitive, defines a fixed size ramp, and sanctions exactly
  three placements:

  - **stacked** — marketing feature cards (`FeatureTile`, new): tinted tile above
    the title; collapses to an inline icon + title row below 16rem of container
    width.
  - **leading** — content, navigation, and stat cards (`Card` `icon` prop,
    `QuickLink`, `StatCard`): tile aligned to the title block.
  - **inline** — bare glyphs at text size (16px) inside checklist/meta rows.

  Trailing/corner icon placement is no longer sanctioned; `Card.headerRight` is
  for actions and badges only.

  **`IconBadge` / `iconBadgeVariants` (breaking):**

  - New size ramp with a constant 2:1 tile-to-glyph ratio: `sm` (32px), `md`
    (40px), `lg` (48px), `xl` (64px). The previous `md` (48px) is now `lg`; the
    previous `lg` (64px) is now `xl`. The default changed from `lg` to `md`.
  - New `shape` variant: `square` (default) | `circle`. The badge was previously
    always circular — pass `shape="circle"` to keep a circle (people, status,
    progress); squares are for object/feature/navigation icons.
  - New tones: `info`, `warning`, `destructive` (joining `primary`, `success`,
    `muted`).
  - New exported types: `IconBadgeSize`, `IconBadgeShape`, `IconBadgeTone`.

  **`Card` (breaking):**

  - `variant="feature"` removed from `Card`/`cardVariants` — use the new
    `FeatureTile` component instead.
  - New `variant="flush"` — a card surface with no internal padding for callers
    that compose their own internal layout (previously reachable by abusing
    `variant="feature"` without header props).
  - `icon` now takes a `LucideIcon` component (was `ReactNode`) and renders as a
    leading tinted tile in the header, aligned to the title block, on every
    variant (previously the prop only rendered on the removed `feature`
    variant). New `iconTone` prop tints the tile.

  **Removed exports** (each with its replacement):

  - `CardIconEl` (html layer, bare 40px glyph container) → `IconBadgeEl` /
    `IconBadge`.
  - `TileIconEl` and `TileIconElProps` (html layer, tile-internal icon
    container) → `IconBadgeEl` (`size="md"`).
  - `statCardIconVariants` → `iconBadgeVariants`; `StatCard` now renders its
    icon inside `IconBadgeEl` (square, ramp sizes `sm`/`md`/`lg` tracking card
    density).

  **New exports:** `FeatureTile`, `FeatureTileProps`, `featureTileVariants`,
  `featureTileHeaderVariants`, `IconBadgeSize`, `IconBadgeShape`,
  `IconBadgeTone`, and a `hero` size on `stepBubbleVariants`.

  **Visual-only changes (no API impact):** `QuickLink` and `StatCard` icon tiles
  now render through the shared badge primitive (stat-card tiles are now rounded
  squares on the ramp instead of bespoke circles); `StepIndicator`'s number
  bubble renders through the step-bubble primitive; `CardHeaderEl` gained a
  `gap-4` between the title block and `headerRight`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [888d537]
  - @bota-apps/tailwind-preset@0.9.0

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 86b5ae3: StatCard and DetailField robustness fixes:

  - `StatCard` is now a size container and hides its `chart` slot below ~19rem of card width, so a fixed-width sparkline can no longer starve the label/value column in dense grids.
  - `DetailField` hosts its `value` in a block-safe wrapper instead of a `<p>`, fixing invalid `<p><p>` nesting (and the React hydration warning) when the value is itself block-level content such as a `Text` paragraph.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 5ff7de0: Depth/motion polish across the kit, plus new engagement components.

  Visual changes (no API removals):

  - Components now render on the semantic elevation tiers (`shadow-raised/overlay/floating`) instead of raw `shadow-sm/md/lg`; dialog and sheet panels moved from `bg-background` to the popover surface tier, so dark mode separates them from the page (identical in light mode).
  - `Skeleton` upgraded from a pulse to a shimmer sweep (`motion-reduce` aware).
  - Buttons gained subtle press feedback via the shared `pressableClasses` recipe in the interaction module.
  - Hardcoded transition durations normalized onto the motion tokens; right-aligned table cells now use tabular figures.

  New components:

  - `Timeline`/`TimelineItem` — vertical event timeline with tone variants.
  - `CommandPalette` + `Command*` subcomponents and `useCommandPaletteShortcut` — ⌘K action launcher (wraps cmdk inside the design-system Dialog).
  - `Kbd` — keyboard-key chip.
  - `Sparkline` (on the `./charts` subpath) — minimal inline trend line; `StatCard` gained a `chart` slot to host it.
  - `Hero` moved from the section module into its own module: same `title`/`description`/`actions` props (imports from the package barrel are unaffected), plus new `treatment` (`glow` | `grid` | `tint`) and `align` props for tokenized, brand/dark-aware background surfaces.
  - `EmptyState` gained a `variant="tinted"` icon presentation.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 38fd879: `Logo` is now app-configurable instead of hard-coding a wordmark and asset path. New props: `name` (wordmark text, default `"Bota Apps"`), `src` (image source, default `"/images/logo.png"`), and `alt` (defaults to `"<name> logo"`).

  Migration: apps that relied on the previously baked-in wordmark must now pass their own `name` (and optionally `src`/`alt`). No exports were removed; `logoVariants` is unchanged.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c59a99: Interaction-state overhaul and container-scoped responsiveness. No exports were removed or renamed — this is a visual/behavioral refinement release.

  **Interaction states no longer use `accent`.** The `accent` token is a brand-emphasis color that apps rebrand to saturated hues, so hover/selected surfaces built on it rendered as loud brand fills. Every interaction surface now follows one rule:

  - transient hover/press surfaces → `muted` (buttons `outline`/`ghost`, menu/select/combobox rows, calendar day hover, nav links, pagination, tiles, dialog close)
  - persistent on/active states → new `selected` / `selected-foreground` tokens (Toggle/ToggleGroup on-state, combobox selected option, calendar range, active nav item)

  Apps that deliberately want accent-colored surfaces can still apply `bg-accent` utilities explicitly.

  **One shared focus/hover recipe.** New `focusRingClasses` and `formControlInteractionClasses` fragments (exported from the package root) now style Input, Textarea, Select/Combobox triggers, Button, and Toggle: a soft 2px ring at reduced opacity plus a ring-colored border on field controls, and a border tint on hover — consistent across every control and both themes.

  **Controls adapt to their container, not the viewport.** `FormGrid`, `QuickLinkGrid`, the DataTable card-grid layout, and `Stepper` now use container queries (the components render their own `@container` scope): a two-column form grid collapses to one column inside a narrow panel even on a wide screen, and the Stepper swaps per-step labels for a compact "Step x of n" summary below the `@2xl` container width. Requires `@bota-apps/tailwind-preset` from this release (it now ships the container-queries plugin).

## 0.5.4

### Patch Changes

- b553354: DataTableRowActions: stop click propagation from the menu trigger, content, and items. On a table wired with both `onRowClick` and `rowActions`, React synthetic events bubbled out of the (portalled) menu up the React tree, so opening a row's menu — or clicking any menu item — also fired the row's `onRowClick` (e.g. navigating away before a confirm dialog could open). The selection checkbox cell already guarded this; the actions cell now does too.
- 627fd1d: Add document-row chrome (print-fidelity, statement/invoice/report-style artifacts) so consumers can drop the remaining raw-`className` escape hatches:

  - **Inline**: `background` gains `primary` (`bg-primary/10`) and `primarySubtle` (`bg-primary/5`) tints; new `borderTop` boolean (`border-t`); `paddingX` gains `xl` (`px-8`); `paddingY` gains `xl` (`py-5`); `indent` gains `xl` (`pl-12` — indent values pair with the same-named `paddingX`, they are not an absolute scale); new `accent` boolean — a left accent bar (`border-l-[3px] border-l-primary`) for document/section headers.
  - **Div**: `background` gains the same `primary`/`primarySubtle` tints; `border` gains `bPrimary` (`border-b border-primary/20`) and `bPrimarySubtle` (`border-b border-primary/10`) tinted bottom borders; new split padding scales `paddingX` (`xs`–`xl`, `px-1`–`px-8`) and `paddingY` (`xs`–`xl`, `py-1`–`py-8`) alongside the all-sides `padding`.
  - **DotLeader** (new primitive, exported from the package root): a dotted leader line for label……value rows — drop it between the label and the value inside an `Inline` row; it grows to fill the gap (`flex-1 border-b border-dotted border-border/50 mx-3`, nudged up to the text baseline) and is `aria-hidden`. `dotLeaderVariants` is exported alongside it.

  All additive and optional; no existing API changes.

## 0.5.3

### Patch Changes

- 378d1c2: Fix the DynamicForm currency field to honor its plain-number data contract. The renderer emitted a Money-shaped `{ amount, currency }` object, so any form with a currency widget failed zod validation ("must be a number") and never submitted — zodBuilder, the normalizer, and gql-codegen's widget policy all expect a plain number (SDL pattern: `<field>Amount: Float @widget(type: currency)`). Money stays display-only.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 2249836: Shared host-router factory and an accessible name for the page-actions trigger:

  - **react-components**: `createHostRouter(routeTree, history?)` — owns the router options every host must agree on (`defaultPreload: "intent"`, the shared `NotFound`/`RouteError` surfaces, the runtime-injected context placeholder). Apps keep a thin `createAppRouter = (history?) => createHostRouter(routeTree, history)` wrapper so their `Register` declaration and page tests keep working unchanged. Also `PageContainer` gains `menuActionsLabel`, forwarded to the menu trigger. (The react-components size budget grew to 110 kB: the factory pulls `createRouter` into the bundle — code every host already ships for its own router, so real apps see no net growth.)
  - **react-ui**: `PageMenuActions` names its icon-only trigger for screen readers — new `triggerLabel` prop, default `"Page actions"`, overridable for translation. Tests and assistive tech can now address the trigger as `getByRole("button", { name: "Page actions" })`.

  Both additive; no existing API changes.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 7b64e3c: Add layout/display variants so consumers can drop remaining raw-`className` escape hatches:

  - **Avatar**: `size` (`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl`) on `Avatar` and `AvatarFallback` — root sizes the circle, fallback tracks the initials size. Defaults to `md` (unchanged from today).
  - **Card**: `fill` — stretches the card to its parent's width and height (grid/flex cells, e.g. org-chart nodes).
  - **Inline**: row chrome for list/selectable rows — `paddingX`, `paddingY`, `borderBottom`, `background` (`muted`), and `indent` (nested rows; combines with `paddingX`, deeper `pl-*` wins the left side).
  - **Stack**: `width` (fixed-width leading column, `xs`–`xl`) and `shrink` (`"0"`) — pair them for a labeled row's fixed column; the flexible column already uses `grow`.
  - **Text**: `mono` and `tabular` booleans — monospace face and tabular figures for aligned numeric ranges.

  All additive and optional; no existing API changes.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 0671cc2: `PhoneDisplay` is now country-agnostic — no built-in locale. The number is shown as given unless you supply formatting props.

  Migration:

  - Removed the `variant` prop and the `PhoneDisplayVariant` type, along with the hard-coded default normalization/grouping.
  - Added `countryCode?: string` (calling code applied to national-form input, dropping a leading trunk `0`) and `groups?: number[]` (segment lengths for the national part).
  - To reproduce the previous default, pass `countryCode="251"` with `groups={[3, 2, 2, 2]}`; for the old `"international"` layout use `groups={[3, 3, 3]}`.

### Patch Changes

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- fd42c7e: Platform foundations: API-owned user schema (generic auth), feature-gating collectors, a utils package, and a mocks package (breaking on 0.x — released as minor per repo policy).

  **Design rule codified: domain schemas are owned by the API.** Packages never define types the API provides (users, organizations, audit entries, pagination envelopes); they are generic over them and declare only the minimal structural constraints they rely on.

  **New: `@bota-apps/utils`** — framework-free utility modules, one subpath per concern:

  - `./type` — the `Equal`/`Expect` type-assertion helpers (moved from the removed `@bota-apps/types/testing` subpath).
  - `./time` — the date formatting presets (moved from the removed `@bota-apps/schema-utils/dates` subpath; same function names).
  - `./number` — `formatNumber` (moved from the schema-utils main entry).

  **New: `@bota-apps/mocks`** — in-memory doubles for tests/stories, organized by module (`src/auth/…`), depending only on `@bota-apps/types` (shapes, no runtime packages). `createMockAuthClient` returns the REAL `AuthClient` type (no extra test-only surface), starts from a `user` or full `state`, and simulates organization switching through an app-provided `resolveSwitch(organizationId, user)` mapping — the mock doesn't presume any user schema.

  **types**

  - **BREAKING:** `User`/`UserRole` removed — the user type is API-owned.
  - New `./auth` subpath — the auth contract SHAPES, mirroring the fm shape/runtime split: `SessionUser` (the minimal constraint the runtime expects on the session user: `id`, `name`, `email`), `AuthRegister`/`RegisteredAuthUser`, `AuthState` and its members, `AuthStore`, `AuthClient`, `SessionEndpoint`, `SessionPaths`. Shape-only consumers (e.g. mocks) depend on `types` alone.
  - **BREAKING:** the `./testing` subpath is removed — import `Equal`/`Expect` from `@bota-apps/utils/type`.

  **auth-client**

  - The whole surface is now generic over the app's API-owned user type: `AuthState<TUser>`, `AuthStore<TUser>`, `SessionEndpoint<TUser>`, `AuthClient<TUser>`, `createAuthClient<TUser>` (all constrained to `SessionUser`). The shapes live in `@bota-apps/types/auth` (re-exported here for convenience); the package keeps only the runtime. Register the app's user type once via declaration merging — `declare module "@bota-apps/types/auth" { interface AuthRegister { user: ApiUser } }` — and every surface (including `useAuth`) is typed with it app-wide, no generics at call sites.
  - **BREAKING:** `SessionPaths` gains a required `switchOrganization` path (default `/bff/switch-organization`). `AuthStore`/`AuthClient`/`useAuth` gain `switchOrganization(organizationId)` — re-targets the session on the host/BFF, then re-resolves the user (superseding any in-flight resolution; a failed switch leaves the current state untouched). Organization data itself lives on the app's registered user type.

  **schema-utils**

  - **BREAKING:** the `./dates` subpath moved to `@bota-apps/utils/time`, and `formatNumber` moved to `@bota-apps/utils/number` (same names).

  **fm**

  - Gating collectors land (the resolver's "phase 5"): `flagCollector`, `permissionCollector` (hide — don't advertise), `planCollector`, `limitCollector`, `setupCollector` (block — advertise but gate). Generic collectors only — app-specific policies (billing, compliance, region, …) are app-defined `FeatureCollector`s passed via `FeatureProvider`'s new `collectors` prop. Gated nodes fail closed against the app-provided `FeatureGateContext` (`context` prop).
  - `FeatureNodeDef` gains declarative gating keys (`flag`, `planFeature`, `limit`, `setup` — alongside the existing `permissions`); new shapes `FeatureGateContext`, `FeatureCollector`, `CollectorVerdict`, `ResolvedFeatureNode`.
  - New hooks `useFeature`, `useFeatureStatus`, `useFeatureChildren`, `useFeatureTree`, and the unstyled `FeatureGate` component (`whenBlocked`/`whenHidden` render slots). `useFeatureScope` is gating-aware, with ancestor verdicts cascaded in (a page inside a hidden module is hidden).
  - New tree utilities: `resolveFeaturePath`, `resolveFeatureTree`, `composeFeatureTree`; `FeatureRegistry` gains `getPath` and now **throws on duplicate feature ids** instead of silently overwriting.

  **hooks**

  - New `usePaginatedQueryPipeline` — a query pipeline for paginated lists that keeps the previous page's data as placeholder while the next page loads.

  **react-ui**

  - Internal: date formatting now comes from `@bota-apps/utils/time` (no API change).

- Updated dependencies [fd42c7e]
  - @bota-apps/utils@0.1.0
  - @bota-apps/types@0.4.0
  - @bota-apps/schema-utils@0.4.0

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8547b92: Per-component module structure and a complete variants surface.

  Every visual component now lives in its own directory (`index.tsx` + `variants.ts` + colocated story and test) and **exposes its cva variants publicly**: consumers can import `<name>Variants` (e.g. `dialogContentVariants`, `selectTriggerVariants`, `statCardVariants`, `navItemVariants`) from the package barrel, plus `VariantProps`-derived unions where useful. Existing exported names (`buttonVariants`, `badgeVariants`, `toggleVariants`, `sidebarMenuButtonVariants`, `navigationMenuTriggerStyle`, …) are unchanged.

  Also:

  - New `@bota-apps/react-ui/form` subpath export — the react-hook-form integration was documented as deep-importable but never declared in `exports`; published consumers can now actually resolve it.
  - `LoadingBusiness` is now exported under its own name (it previously shadowed `Loading` internally).
  - Import specifiers are unchanged — the package barrels re-export the same names from the same entry points; no consumer action needed beyond the removals listed in the fresh-library-cleanup changeset.

- 945096b: Discriminated-union state contracts (breaking on 0.x — released as minor per repo policy).

  **auth-client**

  `AuthState` is now a discriminated union on `status` instead of a single type with optional fields. Narrowing the status narrows the payload: `user` is a `User` (never `undefined`) exactly when `status === "authenticated"`, and `error` is a required `Error` that exists exactly when `status === "error"`. The members are exported by name — `AuthPendingState`, `AuthenticatedState`, `UnauthenticatedState`, `AuthErrorState` — and `AuthStatus` is now derived (`AuthState["status"]`, same union as before).

  Migration: code that read `state.error` without checking `status` must narrow first (`if (state.status === "error") { state.error }`); code constructing an `AuthState` literal must match one member exactly (e.g. an authenticated state can no longer omit `user`).

  **react-ui**

  `useCopyToClipboard` reports `error` as `Error | undefined` instead of `Error | null` (repo-wide prefer-`undefined` rule). Replace `error === null` checks with `error === undefined` (or just truthiness).

- 8547b92: Remove all deprecated/back-compat API (breaking on 0.x — released as minor per repo policy).

  **react-ui**

  - `DashShell` removed — compose `SidebarProvider + Sidebar + SidebarInset` instead. Its context surface (`DashShellContext`, `useDashShellContext`, `FIXED_LAYOUT`) is removed with it and has no replacement: the sidebar layout no longer needs a fixed-layout marker, so drop those calls.
  - `useIsMobile` removed — use `useBreakpoint().below("md")`.
  - `Text`'s deprecated `format` prop removed — use `<DateTime variant="…" value={…} />`. The `TextFormat` type is removed with it (use `DateTimeVariant`), and the `fmtDate`/`fmtTime`/`fmtDateRange` helpers are now private to the `dateTime` module — for standalone date formatting use `@bota-apps/schema-utils`' `formatDate`/`formatDateShort`.
  - Legacy `CardHeader`/`CardTitle`/`CardDescription`/`CardContent`/`CardFooter` compat primitives removed — use the props-driven `Card` API (`title`, `description`, `footer`, `children`).
  - The raw `CardContentEl`/`CardSectionEl`/`CardFooterEl` html-layer primitives are removed with them — compose `CardEl` with your own layout, or use the `Card` API.

  **types / schema-utils**

  - `labelAm` removed from `CurrencyInfo`/`CurrencyDefinition` and the currency registry — resolve localized labels via `getCurrencyLabel(code, t)` / `formatter.getLabel(code, t)`.

  **auth-client**

  - `DEFAULT_SESSION_PATHS` renamed to `defaultSessionPaths` (repo-wide camelCase-constants rule).

- 5237cf9: `DocumentPreview` no longer hard-wires Microsoft's Office Online viewer. A new `officeViewerUrl` prop controls how office documents (docx/xlsx/pptx) are embedded: pass a function to use a self-hosted viewer, `null` to disable office previews for privacy-sensitive documents (they fall back to the unsupported state with working download/open actions), or omit it to keep the current Microsoft viewer default. The `labels` overrides now also apply to the unsupported-state Download/Open buttons, which previously bypassed them.
- 76d5c75: Package manifest hygiene sweep.

  - **BREAKING (react-ui):** the `react`/`react-dom` peer range narrows from `^18 || ^19` to `^19.0.0`, matching every other package in the family — the packages are developed and tested against React 19 only. Stay on an older react-ui release if your app is still on React 18.
  - Internal `@bota-apps/*` dependencies now use `workspace:^` (rewritten to real versions at publish) so local builds can never resolve a stale published copy.
  - Pure packages declare `"sideEffects": false` for better tree-shaking.
  - Every package declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.

- 3659ce3: Rebuild `Dialog` on `@radix-ui/react-dialog` (matching `AlertDialog`/`Sheet`), replacing the hand-rolled implementation.

  Fixes shipped accessibility defects: the dialog now has proper `role="dialog"` semantics with `aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby` wired to `DialogTitle`/`DialogDescription`, a focus trap with initial focus and focus restoration on close, body scroll lock, working enter/exit animations, and outside content hidden from assistive tech while open. Also fixes `DialogTrigger asChild` silently dropping caller props, and adds a `closeLabel` prop on `DialogContent` and `SheetContent` to localize the sr-only close-button label.

  Migration notes:

  - The export list is unchanged; existing `open`/`defaultOpen`/`onOpenChange` usage works as before.
  - Include a `DialogTitle` in every `DialogContent` (wrap in the `VisuallyHidden` component if the design has no visible title) — Radix warns in dev when it is missing.
  - `DialogContent` now traps focus and locks body scroll while open; interactions that relied on focusing content behind the dialog must move inside it.

### Patch Changes

- 959f6a4: Fix Node16 ESM type resolution for the main entrypoint: tsc synthesizes `import("..")` in a few emitted d.ts files (`alert`, `passwordInput`), and the extension-fixing build step skipped bare `"."`/`".."` specifiers — Node16 consumers hit an internal resolution error. They are now rewritten to `"../index.js"`, and every package build cleans `dist/` first so renamed or deleted sources can no longer leave stale files in the published tarball.
- 55d906b: Fix correctness gaps in form validation and the small utility hooks.

  - **`buildFormZodSchema` / `DynamicForm`**: a required number/currency field no longer accepts empty input — previously `z.coerce.number()` turned `""` into `0`, so an untouched required amount field silently submitted `0`. Empty input now fails with the required message, and `buildDefaultValues` starts required numbers empty instead of at `0`. If an app relied on empty-means-zero, pass `defaultValue: 0` on that field. Validation messages are now overridable for translation via `buildFormZodSchema(fields, { messages })` or the new `validationMessages` prop on `DynamicForm`; empty required fields report "required" before format errors like "invalid email".
  - **`useCopyToClipboard`**: clears its reset timer on unmount, no longer produces an unhandled rejection when clipboard permission is denied (returns `false` and exposes a new `error` field instead), and falls back to `document.execCommand("copy")` in insecure contexts.
  - **`formatRelativeTime`**: rebuilt on `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` — same "5m ago" shape in English below a week, now with a `locale`/`style` option for localization. **Shape change:** durations of 7 days or more roll up to weeks/months/years ("1w ago", "1mo ago", "1y ago") where the old implementation rendered unbounded day counts ("45d ago"). Invalid dates return `""` instead of "NaNd ago", and future timestamps format as "in 5m" instead of clamping to "0m ago".
  - **`usePrint`**: `isPrinting` no longer sticks `true` forever in browsers that never fire `afterprint` (Safari, canceled dialogs) — the hook settles on window refocus or after a bounded fallback timeout, and the print iframe is torn down on the next print call instead of the moment the promise settles, so a still-open dialog can't spool a blank document.

- 2d71b67: Fix publish-surface issues surfaced by `arethetypeswrong` (now enforced in CI alongside `publint`).

  - **auth-client**: the emitted `d.ts` for `useAuth` contained a synthesized `import("..")` directory specifier that Node16 ESM consumers cannot resolve; `useAuth` now has an explicit `UseAuthResult` return type (also a nicer public type to reference).
  - **tailwind-preset / react-ui**: the `./preset` and `./postcss` subpath exports now ship type declarations — TypeScript `tailwind.config.ts` files get typed imports instead of `any`.

- 1bf0fca: Review fixes across the packages.

  **tailwind-preset**

  - Opacity modifiers work on numeric ramp shades again: `bg-primary-500/20` and friends compiled to nothing because Tailwind v3 cannot parse `var()` colors with space-separated fallbacks. The ramp defaults now live as `--primary-50..900` / `--secondary-50..900` / `--accent-50..900` variables in `theme.css` (rebrand by redefining them) and the preset references them without inline fallbacks.

  **schema-utils** (breaking on 0.x — released as minor per repo policy)

  - `createCurrencyFormatter` fails fast instead of limping on fake values: a custom code set now requires its own `currencies` registry (enforced by overloads), and formatting or labelling a code missing from the registry throws instead of rendering placeholder metadata.
  - Non-ISO custom codes (`USDT`, anything not three letters) no longer crash `Intl.NumberFormat` — they render symbol-prefixed.
  - `Intl.NumberFormat` instances are cached per locale/options, so per-cell `CurrencyText` rendering stops re-resolving locale data on every call.
  - `CurrencyDefinition` is now derived from `CurrencyInfo` (same shape, open `code`).

  **auth-client**

  - Fixed three auth-state races: a superseded in-flight session resolution can no longer overwrite the state written by a newer `refresh()`, a slow `getUser()` response can no longer re-authenticate the store after `logout()`, and a stale failure no longer clears a newer refresh's cached resolution.
  - `UseAuthResult` (the return type of `useAuth`) is exported from the package barrel.

  **react-ui**

  - The chart cva variants (`barChartVariants`, `lineChartVariants`, `areaChartVariants`, `pieChartVariants`) are now actually reachable from `@bota-apps/react-ui/charts` and the root barrel.
  - `DynamicForm` no longer crashes when a validation message key is passed explicitly `undefined` (e.g. from an optional translator) — it falls back to the English default per key.
  - `formatRelativeTime` caches its `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` instances.

  **react-components**

  - `ThemeProvider` memoizes its context value, so `useTheme` consumers stop re-rendering on unrelated parent re-renders.
